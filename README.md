# Molecular Biology 254D README

This repository contains the R scripts for the molecular biology 254D course.

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of this course students are expected to learn:

Fudamental concepts in statistics
* Obtain summaries of data using numbers and graphs including confidence statements about the data (confidence intervals, p-values, etc.)
* Recognize statistical models, what they are, why we need them. 
* Summarize observations with many attributes (high dimensional) using unsupervised learning, i.e., principal component analysis (PCA), non-linear dimensionality reduction, and clustering

Practical data analysis in the statistical programming language R
* Data import and wrangling
* Visualize and interpret data
* Build and evaluate statistical models
* Perform dimensionality reduction and clustering in R

## Course Requirements / Prerequisites
To get set up for the course you will first need to do one of the following:
* Create an account in Posit cloud: https://posit.cloud/ (this is a cloud-based R Studio environment)
* download and install R: https://cran.r-project.org/ and install R studio desktop from posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/

Once you are set up with the R Studio environment, you can download this repository from the homepage by clicking on the green "Code" dropdown button and selecting download zip. To access it in your R studio environment:
* In Posit.cloud using the "files" tab in the bottom right hand corner of R Studio, select the "upload" button and upload the .zip file.
* In R Studio Desktop, save the .zip file to your desktop and unzip the file. 

## How to navigate the course
The course is divided into 10 sessions that build on each other. Review the powerpoint slides before attempting the coding sessions. Solutions to the challenges, and examples in the coding portion can be found in the Solutions folder. 
Session 9 is copied from the Seurat Guided Clustering Tutorial with minor modifications, the link to the original source is in the lesson.
